# A-Digital-Menu-of-my-resturant
January 3rd, 2026. I built this website, which is primarily a platform where you can view menus from various food sectors, including Appetizers, Main Course, and more.  
Just a friendly reminder, the images I used on my website are not showing for some reason, but if you want to see them, you could just click on the PNG files I've given in the repository.
